             <h2>History of each typeface</h2>

			 <h3>Bodoni</h3> <!-- Older typeface first, please. -->
             <p>Bodoni is a typeface that was originally designed by Giambattista Bodoni, an Italian typographer, printer, and engraver.</p>
             <p>Born in 1740 in Saluzzo, Italy, Bodoni began his career in typography at a young age, eventually becoming the head of the Royal Press of the Duke of Parma. </p>
             <p>It was during his time in Parma, in the late 18th century, that Bodoni created his most famous work: a series of typefaces that would revolutionize printing and design. Bodoni's typefaces, characterized by their extreme contrast between thick and thin strokes, precise geometric forms, and elegant serifs, reflected the neoclassical ideals of the time. His meticulous attention to detail and dedication to precision resulted in typefaces that were not only visually striking but also highly functional.</p>
			 <p>Today, Bodoni's legacy lives on through his enduring influence on typography and design, with modern renditions of Bondoni typefaces such as this one being influenced by his original designs.</p>
             
			 <h3>Didot</h3> <!-- Second typeface here. -->
             <p>Firmin Didot, a member of the renowned Didot family of printers, was a prominent figure in French typography during the late 18th century. Born in Paris in 1764, Didot was surrounded by printing and publishing from an early age, as his family operated one of the most successful printing businesses in France.</p>
             <p>In 1784, he began work on a typeface that would come to be known as Didot, characterized by its sharp contrast between thick and thin strokes, vertical stress, and geometric precision. Didot's typefaces quickly gained popularity and became synonymous with elegance and sophistication, particularly in French publishing circles. </p>
             <p>Today, the typefaces influenced by Didot's original continue to be celebrated for their timeless beauty and classic appeal, serving as a testament to Firmin Didot's enduring legacy in the world of typography and design.</p>

			    
			<h2>Comparison</h2>

			<h3>Similarities</h3>
