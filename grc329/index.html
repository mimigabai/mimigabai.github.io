<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>This case study will cover key stages such as market research, ideation, technical implementation, prototyping stages, and manufacturing considerations that went into redesigning an existing product to make it interactive.</p>

<p>Witness the transformation of "Sorry!" into a more interactive and engaging gaming experience, where strategic design choices and user-centric principles converge to revive this beloved classic.</p>

<p>The process of developing the redesigned "Sorry!" board game honed a diverse set of skills, including strategic thinking, user-centric design, market research analysis, rapid prototyping, effective problem-solving, and arduino wiring and programming.</p>

    <h3>Market Research</h3>
    
    <h4>Market</h4>
    <p>The global board game market was worth around $7.2 billion in 2017. The board game market is expected to be valued at $12 billion in 2023. (Source: https://techjury.net/blog/board-game-statistics/)</p>
    
    <h4>Competetive Analysis</h4>
    <p>Currently, there are a few board games on the market with interactive electronic features including Hasbro's Monopoly Electric Banking and Operation.</p>

    <h4>Sorry! Target Audience Unmet Needs</h4>
    <p>Game is silent, does not light up and has no interaction compared to online games popular with kids today.</p>
    
</section>

<a id="ideas">
<section>
    <h3>Idea Generation</h3>
    <p>To start, we came up with three concepts for adding electronic sensors and actuators to the game to make it more interactive.</p>
    <figure>
        <img src="concept1.png">
    </figure>
    <h4>Concept 1</h4>
    <p>Add a button to play fun sounds from speaker when pressed, add another speaker for sounds played when pawns arrive home, add an RGB LED that turns on by photosensor when box is closed.</p>
    <figure>
        <img src="concept2.png">
    </figure>
    <h4>Concept 2</h4>
    <p>Add LEDs turned on by a sensor each time a pawn arrives home, when all four have arrived servo motor spins sorry logo in center of board, button to change color of RGB LED indicating player turn.</p>
    <figure>
        <img src="concept3.png">
    </figure>
    <h4>Concept 3</h4>
    <p>Similar to above, add LEDs turned on by sensor each time a pawn arrives home, when all four have arrived servo motor spins sorry logo in center of board, have a button to play fun sounds from speaker </p>

    <h3>Design Process</h3>
    <p>In the development of our product, we followed a user-centered design process and also considered agile methodology. By conducting user research and incorporating user feedback, we were able to craft a product that meets functional requirements but also provides an intuitive and satisfying experience for our target audience.</p>

    <h4>User Persona</h4>
    <p>Ava, 8 years old, Likes playing with her iPad. Enjoys games that are: Colorful, memorable, engaging, and competetive.</p>

    <h4>Problem Statement</h4>
    <p>A kid needs an especially interactive board game to keep them engaged in order to spend less time on screens. </p>
    
    
    <h4>Ideation and Concept Development</h4>
    <p>We started by coming up with three different concepts of how we could add features and functionality to the existing game on sorry.</p>

        <a class="link" href="#ideas">See more about Ideas</a>

    <h4>Protyping and Iteration</h4>
    <p>During the prototyping phase we started with a lofidelity prototype using TinkerCad to set up our circuit and simulate some of the functions.
    <p>Next, we made a mid fidelity prototype using a card board box and a physical arduino.</p>
    </p>

    <h4>User testing and feedback</h4>
<p>In our lab environment, it was a bit difficult to collect feedback from users. However, we spoke with our classmates to get feedback and ideas during the phases of the development of the product. First, in the idea generation phase we ask our desk-mates which features they felt were the most exciting. THe other lab groups agreed that having the speaker to play fun sounds was important. With this feedback, we chose to move on to a final product with this feature.</p>

    <p>The Mid-Fidelity prototype was a good way to create a proof of concept, and demonstrate that we can use a processor and some actuators to achieve the interactions we wanted to add to the game. It was a bit clunky and complicated, but it was nice to bring the idea to life. If we had more time it could have improved by printing the design of the board game instead of drawing it.</p>

    <h3>Move towards Higher Fidelity</h3>
    <p>In our early prototype, the goal was to "do just enough". Our prototype was very low risk and low cost and allowed us to see that our product had potential. Our goal for our next prototype would be for it to be ready for users to intereact with so that we can conduct testing. This would include consolidating the arduino, breadboard and wiring (it can be placed in a box underneath the board), and making the board printed so that it is cleaner and ready for a user to interact with.</p>
    <p>For our user testing phase, it would be important to find out how easy it was for users to learn and understand the features we added to the game. Additionally, it would be helpful to find out how much users value and appreciate the new interactions.</p>

    <h3>Design for Manufacturability</h3>

        <figcaption>Example of a custom module from henzhenlexing.en.made-in-china.com</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>When manufacturing the product to market, we will need to move towards producing customized modules. This will allow for modules that are thinner and more precise to our needs.</p>
    <p>Once it is established which custom components need to be made, they can be produced using screen printing as part of the production for the processor and some of the traces. There will also need to be connections to connect the components to form a module (batteries, actuators, processor need to be connected). This can be done with various flat connectors to help keep things together and flat.</p>

    <h3>Reflection</h3>
    <h4>Personal Learning Journey</h4>
    <p>Throughout the development of the "Sorry! Reimagined", my personal growth has been marked by a journey encompassing user-centered design, technical implementation, and project management.</p>
    <h4>Transferable Skills</h4>
    <p>In the course of this project, skills in research, rapid-prototyping, programming, wiring, problem-solving, user-centered design, and teamwork were developed. These are skills valauble both in product design and in other disciplines.</p>
    <h4>Conclusion</h4>
    <p>The "Sorry! Reimagined" case study was a comprehensive learning experience, and delved into design thinking, technical implementation, and teamwork. It helped develop skills that go beyond interactive product development. I'm eager to apply these lessons in future projects, embracing an iterative and user-centric approach to design.</p>
