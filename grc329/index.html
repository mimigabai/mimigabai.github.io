<h1>Sorry! Reimagined: A Case Study on Tangible Interactive Product Development</h1>
</header>
<section>
<h3>Fall Quarter 2023</h3>
<h3>Term Project for GrC 329: Tanglible Interactive Product Development</h3>
<h3>Dr. Rong, California Polytechnic State University, San luis Obispo</h3>
</section>
<section>
<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>This case study will cover key stages such as market research, ideation, technical implementation, prototyping stages, and manufacturing considerations that went into redesigning an existing product to make it interactive.</p>

<p>Witness the transformation of "Sorry!" into a more interactive and engaging gaming experience, where strategic design choices and user-centric principles converge to revive this beloved classic.</p>

<p>The process of developing the redesigned "Sorry!" board game honed a diverse set of skills, including strategic thinking, user-centric design, market research analysis, rapid prototyping, effective problem-solving, and arduino wiring and programming.</p>

    <h3>Market Research</h3>
    
    <h4>Market</h4>
    <p>The global board game market was worth around $7.2 billion in 2017. The board game market is expected to be valued at $12 billion in 2023. (Source: https://techjury.net/blog/board-game-statistics/)</p>
    
    <h4>Competetive Analysis</h4>
    <p>Currently, there are a few board games on the market with interactive electronic features including Hasbro's Monopoly Electric Banking and Operation</p>
    
    <h4>User Persona</h4>
    <p>Ava, 8 years old, Likes playing with her iPad. Enjoys games that are: Colorful, memorable, engaging, and competetive.</p>
    
    <h4>Sorry! Target Audience Unmet Needs</h4>
    <p>Game is silent, does not light up and has no interaction compared to online games popular with kids today.</p>
    
    <h4>Problem Statement</h4>
    <p>A kid needs an especially interactive board game to keep them engaged in order to spend less time on screens. </p>

<section>
    <h3>Idea Generation</h3>
    <p>To start, we came up with three concepts for adding electronic sensors and actuators to the game to make it more interactive.</p>
    <h4>Concept 1</h4>
    <p>Add a button to play fun sounds from speaker when pressed, add another speaker for sounds played when pawns arrive home, add an RGB LED that turns on by photosensor when box is closed.</p>
    <h4>Concept 2</h4>
    <p>Add LEDs turned on by a sensor each time a pawn arrives home, when all four have arrived servo motor spins sorry logo in center of board, button to change color of RGB LED indicating player turn.</p>
    <h4>Concept 3</h4>
    <p>Similar to above, add LEDs turned on by sensor each time a pawn arrives home, when all four have arrived servo motor spins sorry logo in center of board, have a button to play fun sounds from speaker </p>

    <h3>Design Process</h3>
    <p>Problem Identification: Describe the user and problem statement for the project.</p>
    <p>Explain the research conducted to understand user needs and requirements.</p>
    <p>Ideation and Concept Development:</p>
    <p>Protyping and Iteration</p>
    <p>User testing and feedback</p>

</iframe>
    <p>Reflect on the effectiveness of the mid-fidelity prototype and any improvements identified (for example, in planning, execution, and skills)</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h3>Move towards Higher Fidelity</h3>
    <p>Discuss the process, tools, and materials needed for moving towards higher fidelity prototyping.</p>
    <p>What are the possible tests needed to examine the prototype before moving into the final product design for mass production?</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h3>Design for Manufacturability</h3>
    <p>Explain any adjustments or design optimizations required for efficient mass production.</p>
    <p>Address manufacturing processes for both physical interfaces and functional components (printing, hybrid, or traditional electronics) for the imaginary final product.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h3>Reflection</h3>
    <p>Personal Learning Journey:
    Reflect on personal growth, skills acquired, lessons learned, and possible future aspirations throughout the project.</p>
    <p>Transferable Skills:
        Highlight transferable skills gained through the project, such as project management, problem-solving, teamwork, or adaptability.</p>
    <p>Conclusion:
        Summarize the key takeaways and personal reflections from the project.</p>
